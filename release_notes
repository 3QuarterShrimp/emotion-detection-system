- Delayed recording until after the "start recording" tone. Sound is now 0.36 seconds instead of 1.6
- File button now opens file explorer to the 'archive' folder of the project using the relative path
- Audio recordings are now immediately saved to 'emotion-detection-system\que' so that they are ready for processing.
  In the event recording is ran again, this file is overwritten.
- Start Stop buttons merged. Just one button now.
- Enviroment related path variables are at the top of home.js
